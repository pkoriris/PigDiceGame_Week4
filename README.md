Red-Green-Refactor workflow - The red, green, refactor approach helps developers compartmentalize their focus into three phases: Red — think about what you want to develop. Green — think about how to make your tests pass. Refactor — think about how to improve your existing implementation

What is Jest- Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly

Why unit test - Unit tests make it safer and easier to refactor the code by putting tests into place that make sure refactoring occurs without problems and disruption. It takes the risk out of changing older source code. Doing unit tests is essentially doing quality assurance of the code.

How can Jest's beforeEach() and afterEach() functions improve our tests? - beforeEach: Runs a function before each test when a file runs. If a function returns a promise or is a generator, Jest waits for the promise to resolve before running the test. afterEach: Runs a function after each test when a file completes
